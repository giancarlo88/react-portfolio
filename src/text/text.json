I was fortunate enough to gain experience using React to build a professional project in my first Junior Developer role. I love using new frameworks, technologies and packages though, and in the modern JavaScript landscape we live in I feel spoiled for choice on what to pick next! (Currently: Three.js)"

Nothing makes me happier than accomplishing something I couldn't previously do (sometimes I high-five myself at my desk)."
